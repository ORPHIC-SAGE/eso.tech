— Machine Learning & Computational Inquiry


Welcome to my GitHub workspace — a living archive of experiments, discipline, and deliberate growth in Machine Learning and applied intelligence.

This repository represents more than code. It reflects a journey shaped by curiosity, iteration, and the quiet persistence required to transform abstract theory into meaningful systems. My work sits at the intersection of healthcare, data, and intelligent prediction, with a focus on building models that are not only accurate, but thoughtful in their implications.

## Current Focus

* Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms
* Classification Models (SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
* Healthcare-based Predictive Modelling
* Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing
* Model Evaluation & Comparative Analysis

## Philosophy Behind the Code

I approach Machine Learning not merely as a technical craft, but as an intellectual discipline. Every model here is a lesson in uncertainty, precision, and critical thinking. Accuracy matters — but understanding why a model behaves as it does matters even more.

Progress, to me, is defined by clarity of reasoning, consistency of practice, and the courage to build even when outcomes are imperfect.

## Projects

### 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Model

A binary classification project aimed at predicting diabetic status using patient data. Multiple algorithms were evaluated, with Kernel SVM yielding the most promising performance. This project emphasizes the importance of nonlinear decision boundaries in medical data interpretation.

### 📊 Foundational ML Experiments

A collection of supervised learning implementations built to strengthen mathematical intuition and practical fluency with NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

## Tech Stack

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Learning Trajectory

This repository will continue to evolve as I deepen my engagement with:

* Advanced Model Optimization
* Explainable AI in Healthcare
* Ethical Machine Learning Practices
* Intelligent Systems Design

## Vision

To contribute to a future where Machine Learning systems do not merely predict outcomes, but preserve lives, optimize care, and elevate decision-making in healthcare environments — especially within under-resourced systems.
